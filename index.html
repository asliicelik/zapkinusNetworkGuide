                    <p>The other day, a friend of mine from EEE department asked me for help because their newly installed computer couldn't connect to an old server in their lab. They said both devices were connected to the same switch, and the internet was working fine, but no matter what they tried, the new PC just couldn't reach the server — not even a ping.</p>

                    <p>I offered to take a quick look, and when I checked the switch configuration, I noticed the server was assigned to VLAN 20 while the new PC was in VLAN 10. That's when I explained to them that even though both devices were plugged into the same switch, VLANs create separate virtual networks, so their data can't reach each other without proper routing.</p>

                    <p>I am currently staying in a government dormitory reported that I could only connect one device to the Wi-Fi network at a time. After logging in with my credentials on my phone, trying to connect with my PC  would result in either a redirect loop or full denial of access. The strange part? Even though my both devices used the same username and password, only the first device could use the network.</p>

                    <p>Upon closer analysis, it became evident that the dormitory network uses MAC address filtering at Layer 2, most likely combined with sticky port security on access switches or MAC-based RADIUS authentication. Once a user logs in, their MAC address is associated with their credentials, and only that MAC is whitelisted for future access. This prevents account sharing and enforces a one-device-per-user policy. </p>

                    <p>I was talking to my friend who is currently an intern at a gaming company recently and he told me the following: "We are currently working on a game using the host client approach. If one of the players connects to the game using a VPN, the other player cannot connect to the lobby. While researching how to solve this, I remembered my networking class."</p>

                    <div class="section-label">Solution</div>
                    <p>To solve this problem, I designed a Cisco-based network to show why VPN users could not theoretically establish a printer. It was necessary to detect that the VPN output behind NAT was forced to provide a direct connection and that this could be due to lack of port forwarding or access control lists (ACL). As a solution, it was configured to allow configuration information with port forwarding settings and ACL over NAT. This scenario aims to solve the problems of a player with VPN in a host-client gaming architecture at the network level.</p>

                        The company's DHCP server is only located in the Accounting Office. However, when a new employee connects his computer to the Administration Office, the device cannot access the Internet and cannot obtain an IP address.</p>

                <div class="problem-section">
                    <div class="section-label">Problem</div>
                    <p>While staying in a government dormitory last year, we had a shared network printer connected via Ethernet through a central switch. All the students in the dorm could send print jobs to it from their rooms over the internal network. Everything worked fine—until one day the printer stopped responding completely. At first, I thought it was just a random printer error. But after talking to a few friends, I realized no one was able to print anything. The printer wasn’t even acknowledging jobs. Eventually, a dorm technician came in and had to restart the printer manually to get it working again.

                    <div class="section-label">Solution</div>
                    <p>Later, I discovered that the issue might have been caused by one of the students unknowingly downloading a modded game file that included hidden malware. The infected device began flooding the printer with random UDP packets. Since many printers listen on open UDP ports (like 161 for SNMP or 9100 for raw printing), this flood overwhelmed the printer’s network interface, causing it to freeze or crash entirely.

This experience taught me how easily a simple UDP flood could bring down a critical shared device in a local network—and how something as innocent as a game mod could be a vehicle for a denial-of-service incident.</p>
